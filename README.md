# Washington-Teachers
get important class announcements - only for UDub students (this is the Teachers' version, the post part)

## What is this project about?
It's quite common to miss homework deadlines because you simply forgot about it (personal score: one,
so far, hopefully that's my highest) or say, if a class gets cancelled (or if there's an extra class?), it's
necessary to have a definite way of conveying such information to the students. Simply sending it over
mail or posting an announcement on canvas isn't enough - not for me anyway.

To fix this, we've made Washington Announcements (an android application). Only students with an
"@uw.edu" email address can create an account on this app. Once the email is verified by clicking on a
link sent to the user's uw email address and logging in, students can register to recieve announcements
for the classes they're registered for (or more, but I don't know why anyone would do that). Open the
app, log in (or if you enabled "remember me on this device", save some time) and checkout the new
announcement that was posted regularly and never miss any important announcements!

That is the student interface. There is also a teacher interface (another android application), which is
used to send the announcements, given the class' name, the title and the content of the announcement.
Students' version of the app will automatically update ready for the student to see the new
announcement.
